# Python - Async

This project contains tasks for learning asynchronous programming in Python using `asyncio`.

## Tasks

### 0. The basics of async
Write an asynchronous coroutine that takes in an integer argument (max_delay, with a default value of 10) named wait_random that waits for a random delay between 0 and max_delay (included and float value) seconds and eventually returns it.

**File:** `0-basic_async_syntax.py`

## Requirements

- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.x)
- All files must be executable
- All modules should have documentation
- All functions should have documentation
